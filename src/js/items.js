We&#39;ll let you know if we can make it work for you.\r\n\r\nAverage Shipping Times:\r\n\r\nDomestic (within the US):  1-2 weeks for production; then 2-5 business days.  Standard Domestic Shipping automatically includes package tracking.\r\n\r\nInternational:  1-2 weeks for production; then 2-4 weeks, barring any customs delays.  Standard International Shipping does NOT automatically include package tracking, but it can be added.  Contact us for pricing.\r\n\r\nUnless you&#39;ve already contacted us, your package will be shipped via Standard Mail through the United States Postal Service (USPS).  We offer Expedited Shipping for both Domestic and International orders, but it does cost a little more than Standard Mail.  Contact us for pricing information if you&#39;re curious. \r\n\r\nWondering when it shipped?  Not to worry!  We&#39;ll mark it as shipped and send a confirmation message to whatever email address you provided on your Etsy receipt.\r\n\r\n**International Customers!**\r\nRemember, your package does not include tracking!  When your order ships, you&#39;ll be able to track it until it leaves the United States; after that the information will not update.  Your package is still on it&#39;s way, we promise.  \r\n\r\nShipping time can vary widely depending on the country you hail from.  We ship to hundreds of locations worldwide and do everything we can on our end to make sure your package arrives quickly.  \r\n\r\nYour package could be travelling thousands of miles on a plane, a boat, or both!  Customs procedures and local mail systems are very different for each country, and they may cause extra delays when they process your package into their system.\r\n\r\nMany international orders don&#39;t encounter delays and spend only 2 weeks in the mail. Unfortunately, when there is a delay packages may take several extra weeks to arrive.  In these rare instances, there is very little information we can find out about a package.  While we&#39;d love to say we have a secret personal tracking system that can hunt down your package in seconds with the push of a button, the truth is we don&#39;t.  If it existed we&#39;d buy one in a heartbeat.  \r\n\r\nIf you haven&#39;t contacted us and officially upgraded your order with package tracking, please be patient!  We promise your package still exists and will either make it&#39;s way to you or back to us in time.\r\n\r\nBecause so many things can impact International shipping time, we hope you&#39;ll understand that we can&#39;t guarantee when packages will show up on your doorstep.\r\n\r\n**International Customers, Please Read!**\r\nWhen your package goes through the customs process, there is a chance additional taxes or fees will be assessed.  Unfortunately we are unable to predict when this will happen, as each an every country has different customs policies that could be updated at any time.  Please make sure you&#39;re familiar with your country&#39;s customs policies when ordering from our shop!  If customs fees or taxes are assessed, please note that it is illegal for us to try and pay them on behalf of the customer, or attempt to pay them in advance.  It is also illegal for us to try and circumvent any added fees or taxes customs may apply.  We are only allowed to pay what the United States Postal Service requires of us to ship the package.  This is the shipping cost already included in your purchase price. For more information, please contact your local customs office.\r\n\r\n**To all of our customers!**\r\n\r\nWe will ALWAYS do everything in our power to make sure your package is shipped with enough time to get from us to you.  While we can never 100% guarantee arrival dates for packages, our estimates are usually spot on.  \r\n\r\nBecause we don&#39;t work for the post office, we can&#39;t control or anticipate delays with their (or any shipper&#39;s) service.  We usually do not issue refunds or send replacements for orders that encounter delays beyond our control.  \r\n\r\nIf your package is returned to us because of a mistake we made, we&#39;ll gladly reship the package at our expense.  If a package is returned due to an error on your part; like an incomplete address, package is unclaimed, etc...we may ask that you cover a portion or all of the cost to re-ship the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","policy_refunds":"Every pair of flip flops is made to order to the customers&#39; specifications and we do not stock or sell pre-imprinted flip flops. For this reason refunds and exchanges are typically NOT accepted. If an error occurs on our part, and we send flip flops that are the incorrect color, size, or a different sole design than what was ordered; the flip flops will be replaced with a correct pair at our expense.  We also do not typically accept returns or exchanges due to color differences between our product and how they appear on computer monitors.  Colors may vary due to differences in monitor settings and we strongly encourage customers to contact us if they have any questions at all. \r\n\r\nIf a circumstance arises in which the customer ordered incorrectly (needs a different size, wants a different color, or mis-typed their design, etc\u2026) we reserve the right to approve exchanges on a case by case basis.  In the instance an exchange is approved, we may ask that the customer cover shipping expenses or a portion of the cost of the replacement pair.  If you have any questions regarding returns please message us.\r\n\r\nWe do not issue refunds or send replacements for flip flops that are delayed, lost or damaged in the mail.  If you have questions regarding a delayed or missing package, please contact your local post office for domestic orders or your country\u2019s customs office for international orders.  See our shipping policies for more detailed information.\r\n","policy_additional":"Frequently Asked Questions:\r\n\r\n1.  How long will my order take to arrive?\r\n\r\nAverage Shipping Times:\r\nInternational:  1-2 weeks for production; then 2-4 weeks, barring any customs delays.\r\nDomestic (within the US):  1-2 weeks for production; then 2-5 business days.\r\n\r\n2. International Taxes and Customs:\r\n\r\nFlipSidez operates and ships from the USA. Some countries, such as the UK, may require that taxes be paid on consumer goods have been purchased from a foreign vendor (such as us) before they are delivered to the customer in that country. Any taxes and fees such as these are the responsibility of the customer and are not included in our prices or covered by FlipSideFlipFlops.  If you would like more information or have any questions about this policy, please feel free to message us (also see shipping policy above).\r\n\r\n3. Can you deliver the flip flops by a specific date? \r\n\r\nProbably yes, we can be very accommodating and have been known to rush produce and ship flip flops for next day delivery within the USA. We try our best to avoid charging customers additional fees where possible. Contact us with the date you need them delivered by and we will explain what will need to be done to meet that date.\r\n\r\n4. I have a long design, will it fit?\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the design length can vary depending on the size of the flip flop. We have a sizing chart that shows the recommended max number of characters per soles. This chart can be viewed here:\r\nhttps:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/037\/0\/6483739\/il_fullxfull.603546184_npq3.jpg\r\n\r\nIf your design is longer than these recommended lengths, we still may be able to create it.  Just contact us, explain the design you would like, the flip flop size, and we will let you know if it can be done.\r\n\r\n5.  I want to add a symbol but I don\u2019t see it on the available symbols sheet, can it be done?  \r\n\r\nUsually the answer is yes!  If you have a symbol in mind but don\u2019t see it, just send us a message or leave a note in the \u201cnotes to seller\u201d section of the cart when checking out.  We will get back to you and let you know if we will be able to accommodate your custom symbol request.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s always worth double checking our symbols chart, we try to rotate and update our symbols chart with new or recently popular options:\r\nhttps:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/031\/0\/6483739\/il_fullxfull.603546212_d8fc.jpg\r\n\r\n6.  Why is the processing time on my order so long?\r\n\r\nDepending on the time of year we may have higher than usual order volume.  We do our best to keep it under a week whenever possible, but this is especially true in the summer when everyone&#39;s ready for the beach and needs a new pair of sandals for an upcoming vacation.  Because each and every pair is made to order only when a customer makes a purchase, it directly impacts how quickly we can make sandals for outstanding orders.  Please keep this in mind when purchasing, your sandals are handmade to order just for you each and every time you shop with us.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1457457236,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/FlipSideFlipFlops?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/6483739\/iusb_760x100.14995684_8nqv.jpg","num_favorers":5241,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/074\/0\/6483739\/isla_fullxfull.16051578_im3nmhhp.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":169612041,"state":"active","user_id":34503709,"category_id":68887494,"title":"Wedding Flasks - Star Wars inspired Groomsmen - 8oz","description":"*Please see shop announcement for current production time*\r\n\r\nMakes a great gift for the groom, best man, and groomsmen!

These are typically set up to printed on a standard letter sized sheet and each label should be cut to approximately 4&quot; x 3.25&quot;. \r\n\r\nTypically you can use a full shipping label and have it printed on any commercial printer. For instance Office Depot, etc all can print for $0.70 per copy and can even cut it for you!  Or you can send the file to a printer and they will print on cut on their professional machines.   \r\n\r\nIf you are printing labels instead of tags I do not suggest purchasing pre-cut (Avery for instance) labels and attempting to line up the file to their layout.

Insurance included.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.  Insurance Included.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE: Please note that PRIORITY, RUSH & EXPRESS services include insurance for lost or damaged mail.  Standard shipping does NOT include insurance.  Please purchase an upgraded shipping option if you wish to insure your package!\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love\/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (5-7 business days to your door)\r\nPRIORITY Shipping (4-6 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.  Purchase an upgraded shipping option to insure your package.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues or delays with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)  USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs.  USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.)  Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. \r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and\/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!","policy_refunds":"Due to the custom nature of the product, we cannot offer refunds, returns or exchanges once the design process has begun. However, I believe in happy customers so please discuss any issues you have with your order and I will do everything possible to ensure I&#39;ve exceeded your expectations!","policy_additional":"It is important to include all requested info needed to complete your order.  Missing information will likely delay your order shipment.  Design changes or capitalization requests must be stated separately at check out.

Proofs must be approved within 14 days or will be shipped as-is.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that some designs have all lowercase font (disregarding proper noun capitalization) per their design -- although this is intended and recommended it can be changed if stated in a separate sentence as a &quot;request for proper noun capitalization&quot;\r\n\r\n***PRINTABLE PDF POLICY***\r\n\r\nAny download OR for purchase files comes with a non-exclusive limited use license so that the Purchaser\/&quot;Downloader&quot; may use the image for personal use only.

We reserve the right to ship from either shops. \r\n\r\n*Ordering samples before a large order is prudent; however owing to the nature of our business, we cannot guarantee a sample and the final production will look &quot;exactly&quot; alike as we have different machinist and many machines that all engrave \/ print slightly different. If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order.

Kinek has set up secure parcel receiving locations, called Kinek Points, at nearly every major border crossing between the US and Canada. Each location is located on the US side of the border and by signing up for the Kinek service and shipping to one of them, you can receive the same shipping prices as US customers. Once your package arrives, Kinek notifies you (by email, text message, or push notification) and will then store the package for up to 30 days for you. You can then drive to the Kinek Point and pick up the item at a convenient time for you. Upon pick-up, you pay a small fee, usually $5 for packages under 30lbs, far less than international shipping and brokerage fees! Some of the major cities Kinek serves are: Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, London, Kingston, Kelowna, Sault Ste. Marie, Saint John, Fredericton, Calgary and Cornwall.\n\nwww.kinek.com","creation_tsz":1457711602,"ending_tsz":1468248802,"original_creation_tsz":1364584059,"last_modified_tsz":1457711602,"price":"695.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":3,"tags":["Whiskey Barrel"],"category_path":["Housewares"],"category_path_ids":[69150425],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":12595285,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1426366559,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/127895008\/vintage-whiskey-barrel-table-black-top?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":3447,"num_favorers":183,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"collective","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":891,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":443392056,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1364584059,"listing_id":127895008,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/6283354\/il_75x75.443392056_1vte.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/6283354\/il_170x135.443392056_1vte.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/6283354\/il_570xN.443392056_1vte.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/6283354\/il_fullxfull.443392056_1vte.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":443403163,"hex_code":"7F7252","red":127,"green":114,"blue":82,"hue":43,"saturation":35,"brightness":49,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1364584059,"listing_id":127895008,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/6283354\/il_75x75.443403163_c31t.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/6283354\/il_170x135.443403163_c31t.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/6283354\/il_570xN.443403163_c31t.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/6283354\/il_fullxfull.443403163_c31t.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":6283354,"shop_name":"AuntMollysBarrels","user_id":14322428,"creation_tsz":1301844688,"title":null,"announcement":null,"currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":null,"digital_sale_message":null,"last_updated_tsz":1457711602,"listing_active_count":63,"digital_listing_count":0,"login_name":"AuntMollysBarrels","accepts_custom_requests":false,"policy_welcome":null,"policy_payment":null,"policy_shipping":null,"policy_refunds":null,"policy_additional":null,"policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1301844688,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/AuntMollysBarrels?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/6283354\/iusb_760x100.10551930_8md1.jpg","num_favorers":488,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null,"is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":false}},{"listing_id":213959126,"state":"active","user_id":30720498,"category_id":68887494,"title":"Welcome Tote Bags (Clipart 1881) Whiskey Helping Men Dance - Wedding Favors - Personalized Bags - Custom Tote Bags - Wedding Bags","description":"Personalized Non Woven &quot;Large&quot; Wedding Tote Bags are the perfect keepsakes for your friends to remember your special day.
