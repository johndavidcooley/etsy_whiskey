All international orders will have full value declared on customs forms, and will be marked as &quot;merchandise&quot;.

I circled it&#39;s location in the last image and unfortunately the reflection from the lights makes it look worse. The chief goat will cover up part of the bubble if you choose that design. If you purchase this item, you are acknowledging the presence of the bubble. ***\n\nThis listing is for a 23.5 ounce glass decanter with four 10 ounce heavy base glasses sandblasted with your personalization instructions. Please feel free to use the ask a question button if you need help.\n\nI can do other services on this. Use the &quot;ask a question button&quot; to inquire as to what I can put onto this for the service you need.\n\n** DECANTER PERSONALIZATION - NAVY CHIEFS**\nThe front can be personalized with either the CPO\/SCPO\/MCPO pin, CPO skull or a goat.\n\nThe back can be personalized with one of the formats below (text centered) in the format of\n\nENC(SW)\nJoe \nExample\n\n16\nSEPT\n2015\n\nOr years of service in the format of:\n\nMMC(SW)\nJoe \nExample\n1985 ~ 2015\n\nOr &quot;fair winds&quot; in the format of:\n\nMMC(SW)\nJoe \nExample\n\n1985 ~ 2015\nFair Winds\nand\nFollowing Seas\n\nOr the phrase with no name and date:\n\nNAVY\nCHIEFS\nNAVY \nPRIDE\n1893\n\nOr your choice of text of 12 words maximum.

Please contact me with your zip code for an overnight or Priority shipping quote.\r\n\r\nThis is a small shop and each piece of glass has its stencil cut and sandblasted one by one, I do not contract work out to China nor do I do laser engraving, so turnaround time depends on my workload (and the weather since I can&#39;t sandblast during lightning storms).\r\n\r\n****************\r\nOnce payment is received and your order is complete, it will be shipped via either USPS Parcel Post or Priority Mail with a tracking number. \r\n\r\nI will only ship to US addresses including APO\/FPO, Alaska, Guam and Hawaii.\r\n\r\nSmaller items ship via Priority and usually will arrive within a week after mailing.  \r\n\r\nIn regards to shipping quotes, I know it seems expensive but those are the numbers USPS gives me. I am shipping glass, not plastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n***COMBINING ORDERS***\r\nI can do combined shipping quotes for large numbers of items. Please send me a custom order request with everything you want as well as your zip code so I can weigh it and get a quote from USPS. Please request this BEFORE you order, not after. If you order multiple items using separate accounts for each order, your items will be shipped separately according to each account&#39;s order.\r\n***COMBINING ORDERS***\r\n\r\nI can ship to alternate addresses if its a gift, however I will not pack the glass into gift boxes or wrap them since it will make the cost of shipping prohibitive. I can add a gift note to the package if you wish though.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure your both your address on Paypal and Etsy match and is accurate, up to date and complete. If you use the wrong address in either Etsy or Paypal, please send me a convo ASAP with the correct address.\r\n\r\n***Shipping to Hawaii and Guam***\r\nI will ship to Hawaii and Guam, but do note that Parcel Post for larger items is extremely slow on the order of four-five weeks since packages are put onto a boat in California for their trip west. If you want something faster, upgrades to air services (i.e. Priority or Express) can be done if you are willing to pay for it. Smaller items such as beer mugs, pint glasses and whiskey glasses are shipped via Priority and will make it to the islands fairly quickly since they go via air plane instead of boat.","policy_refunds":"Due to the customized nature of my work, all sales are final.\r\n\r\nIf glass arrives in the mail broken, contact me imminently with a photograph of the broken object and I will see what I can do. Usually I will replace broken glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n","policy_additional":"==========================\r\n***DISCOUNTS***\r\n\r\nI do not give military discounts. My glassware is already priced cheaper than it would cost at the base exchange gift shop to have glass custom etched and I&#39;m already effectively working at below minimum wage rates with the prices I set.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nStencils for sandblasting are cut partially by hand, so each piece is slightly unique and may not be 100% identical from glass to glass. \r\n\r\nIf you need absolute perfection, please check with a shop that does computerized laser engraving.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nREVIEWS\/FEEDBACK SPAM: \r\n\r\nEtsy has recently replaced its existing Feedback system with a \u2018Review\u2019 option based on a star rating. Buyers have a certain timeframe in which they are able to leave a review, and in conjunction with this function the Etsy system will send out \u201creminders\u201d if a review has not been left. \r\n\r\nNavyBratGlass considers reminders of this nature to be intrusive and would like to assure all buyers that any \u201creview reminder\u201d emails or messages that they may receive from Etsy DO NOT originate from our shop. We hate being nagged just as much as you do! However, please accept our sincere thanks for any positive reviews that you may choose to submit; we are sorry that Etsy no longer affords sellers the opportunity to do so via the feedback system.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***RUSH ORDERS***\r\n\r\nContact me WITH YOUR ZIP CODE if you need something sooner than 2-3 weeks. Depending on my work schedule, I may be able to do rush orders.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***CUSTOMIZATION***\r\n\r\nIf you want something customized, please contact me before purchasing an item to ensure the text you want will fit on the back if you are not sure. For the most part, names, dates, rates\/ranks will fit without a problem - but on certain pieces, fitting long text is a bit tricky.\r\n\r\nI am sandblasting the glass, not laser etching, so there is a limit to how much text can be placed on much of the glass. Due to the nature of the work, all customizations will be done after the listing is purchased and paid for.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***CUSTOM ART***\r\n\r\nIf you have art you wish to consider having sandblasted onto something, the artwork will need to be black & white and a minimum of 500x500 pixels. I will not custom draw artwork from scratch. Please send a convo with the art you are considering attached so I can look at it to see if it can be sandblasted before you order.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***OTHER INFO***\r\n\r\nSandblasting is done by hand and as a result, no two items will be identical.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of disclosure to buyers, glassware may have flaws from the manufacturer. Examples would be swirls, ripples and air bubbles. However, we do as a general rule try to pick glass pieces to etch that is as clean as possible.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***DONATIONS***\r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, I receive numerous requests for donations of my work to various groups. My apologies, I&#39;d love to help everyone, but I cannot afford to ship glass at my cost all over the world. Any donations I do are to certain local groups and any convos asking for donations will be ignored. And to give folks new to Etsy a heads up so you don&#39;t get in trouble, using the convo system for soliciting donations is against Etsy&#39;s Terms of Use and there are shops on here who will report donation requests as spam.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***WHOLESALE***\r\n\r\nI do not do wholesale orders. Sorry.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1439335675,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"This is an automated reply.\r\n\r\nif you are inquiring about the status

Great vintage illustrations. There is some yelllowing, as you would expect. \n\nThe Four Roses brand was established in 1888. These days, people recognize the brand for Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, but in the 1940s, it was purchased by Seagram and made only Blended Whiskey for the US market. Four Roses Bourbon was marketed to Europe and Asia only. When the brand changed ownership in 2002, the new owners focused solely on Bourbon and discontinued the Blended Whiskey varieties. \n\nFrom wikipedia: Four Roses is a Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey brand owned by the Kirin Brewery Company of Japan. The trademark was probably named for company founder Rufus Mathewson Rose, his brother Origen, and their two sons, although it is somewhat unclear, as several different stories have been told about where the name Four Roses comes from. The Lawrenceburg, Kentucky distillery was built in 1910 in Spanish Mission-style architecture and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nBuyers in St. Louis can avoid shipping charges by picking up their purchases at a local UPS store.
